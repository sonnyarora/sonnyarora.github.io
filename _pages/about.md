My interests are in Software, Machine Learning, Bioinformatics, Number Theory, and Cryptography. Most recently, I was a Computational Scientist in the Mahony Lab at The Pennsylvania State University. Before that, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Emory University. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics under supervision of Kirsten Eisentr&auml;ger.
