title: "[SeqView](https://github.com/seqcode/seqview-web-docker-public)"
excerpt: "When analyzing Multi-Omics data, it is often useful to view the data in a genome browser. Many popular genome browsers exist for this purpose such as IGV, HiGlass, and the UCSC genome browser. However, if a researcher has a large number of Omics Datasets, it is often difficult to browse through these datasets for ad-hoc viewing in a genome browser. Developed as part of the Mahony lab at Penn State, SeqView solves this problem by wrapping popular genome browsers such as IGV and HiGlass around a search system for finding datasets based on metadata. This approach is modular and seamlessly integrates with genome browsers through their API."
